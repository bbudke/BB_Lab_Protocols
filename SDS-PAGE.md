## Procedure
### Gel Preparation
1. Assemble gel casting apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions.
2. Mix together the appropriate amount of separating gel components in a clean glass beaker:

Item | 6% Gel x 1 | 6% Gel x 2 | 8% Gel x 1 | 8% Gel x 2 | 10% Gel x 1 | 10% Gel x 2
:--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---:
Water (ml) | 4.13 | 8.25 | 3.63 | 7.25 | 3.13 | 6.25
30% acrylamide (ml) | 1.50 | 3.00 | 2.00 | 4.00 | 2.50 | 5.00
4X separating buffer (ml) | 1.88 | 3.75 | 1.88 | 3.75 | 1.88 | 3.75

3. Prepare a 1.5 ml tube containing an aliquot of separating gel that will be used to make the "plug":

Item | One gel | Two gels
:--- | ---: | ---:
Separating gel (ml) | 0.4 | 0.8
TEMED (μl) | 0.60 | 1.20
25% APS (μl) | 3.65 | 7.30

4. Add 0.35 ml of the plug solution to each casting apparatus, letting it cover the bottom of the gel evenly so that it forms a nice plug to prevent the separating gel from leaking out when the rest of it is added. After the plug has solidified, pour off the few drops of excluded water that will have formed on top of the plug.
	- The gels in this apparatus often leak, despite the fact that the apparatus has the plate sandwich pressed against a rubber gasket at the bottom with a spring clamp. Casting a small strip of polyacrylamide at the bottom of the gel sandwich is enough to completely prevent leaks. The high TEMED and APS (10 mM each) in the plug solution allow the plug to set in a minute.
5. Add TEMED and APS to the remaining separating gel solution in the beaker each to a final concentration of 6 mM:

Item | One gel | Two gels
:--- | ---: | ---:
TEMED (μl) | 6.75 | 13.50
25% APS (μl) | 41.1 | 82.1

6. Mix the separating gel solution and pour it into the casting apparatus so that it reaches a height of about 5.2 cm from the bottom. Layer each gel with 0.5 ml 100% ethanol, allow the gels to solidify (10 - 15 minutes), and then pour off the ethanol.
7. Mix together the appropriate amount of stacking gel components in a clean glass beaker:

Item | One gel | Two gels
:--- | ---: | ---:
Water (ml) | 2.31 | 4.63
30% acrylamide (ml) | 0.50 | 1.00
4X stacking buffer (ml) | 0.94 | 1.88
TEMED (μl) | 3.37 | 6.75
25% APS (μl) | 20.5 | 41.1

8. Mix the stacking gel solution and pour it into the casting apparatus, filling the remaining space. Insert the comb and clamp the top edges of the glass plate sandwich so that the plates are pressed firmly against the comb using silicone or plastic clamps (metal clamps with damage the glass plates). Allow the gels to solidify (about 15 minutes), remove the comb, and move the gel to the running apparatus.
	- There should be about 1 cm of stacking gel between the bottom of the comb and the top of the separating gel.

### Sample Preparation
1. On ice, combine protein sample, protein sample buffer, and 5X SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer so that:
	- The final concentration of gel loading buffer is 1X.
	- All samples are the same volume.
	- All samples have roughly the same salt concentration; i.e., add blank protein sample buffer to normalize the concentration of buffer components across samples. For example, this is done when varying volumes of sample are added so that each lane contains the same microgram amount of protein.
1. Combine ladder, protein sample buffer, and 5X SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer as above so that the lane with the ladder has the same volume and salt concentration as the sample lanes.
1. Combine an appropriate amount of protein sample buffer and 5X SDS-PAGE to provide blank lanes that have the same volume and salt concentration as the sample lanes.
	- Keeping the amount of salt and other buffer components constant throughout the gel, including the empty lanes, will help reduce ugly anomalies such as concentrated sample lanes stretching out laterally into less concentrated or empty lanes during the gel run.
1. Transfer the protein samples to be loaded to a boiling water bath and boil for 5 minutes.
1. Cool the samples to room temperature and spin down in a microfuge for 1 minute at maximum speed. Samples can be kept at room temperature until ready to load.

### Gel Running
1. Fill the electrophoresis tank with ~ 200 ml 1X running buffer, insert the gels in their running apparatus, and fill the remaining volume in the cathode and anode chambers with 1X running buffer so that the glass back plates are sticking up above the buffer by about 1 mm.
	- This requires about 900 ml of fresh 1X running buffer.
1. Flush out each of the wells with running buffer using a syringe and needle.
1. Load ladder, samples, and blanks into the wells.
1. Run at 90V until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.
	- Typically 2 hours and 15 minutes for a 10% gel.
