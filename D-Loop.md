# D-loop Assay
Adapted from protocol by Yuen-Ling Chan (University of Chicago)
___
## Overview
The D-loop assay detects homologous strand invasion catalyzed by recombinase proteins such as RecA and RAD51. A labeled oligonucleotide (e.g. a 90-mer with a 5' Cy5 or <sup>32</sup>P label) is first incubated with recombinase protein to allow formation of nucleoprotein filaments and then a negatively-supercoiled dsDNA plasmid with homology to the oligonucleotide is added. Strand invasion is detected as a slower-migrating band on an agarose gel corresponding to the labeled oligonucleotide complexed with the plasmid.

## Gel Preparation
- Make gels and buffers the day of use.
- If using autoclaved glassware, rinse it with deionized water to remove any residue from the autoclave.
- Prepare a single stock of 1X TAE buffer sufficient for all gels and electrophoresis tanks.
	- The TAE buffer used in this assay is different from the Sambrook et al recipe: the final pH of the 1X solution is 7.5 and the conductivity is XX μS/μs.
	- If using the medium-size gel rigs, make 90 ml for one gel (up to 20 lanes), 190 ml for two gels (up to 40 lanes), and 690 ml for each electrophoresis tank, plus some dead volume.
- Prepare 0.9% agarose 1X TAE gels: boil in microwave for 2:30 min (1 gel) or 3:30 min (2 gels), add Milli-Q water to replace any evaporated volume, cool to 45 - 55 °C, and pour 90 ml into each casting tray. Cover loosely to protect from dust.

## Reaction Setup
### Materials And Reagents
- Plastics: Avoid using anything that has been autoclaved. The residue from the autoclave can inhibit many biochemical reactions. Use regular DNAse-free RNAse-free low-adhesion polypropylene tubes and tips.
- Recombinase proteins: These should be stored in single-use aliquots at -80 °C that have undergone no more than three total freeze-thaw cycles.
- The supercoiled dsDNA plasmid target is CsCl-purified plasmid from _E. coli_. There should be no more than 5% nicked plasmid in the preparation.
- Store ATP, TCEP/DTT, BSA, and ssDNA at -20 °C in aliquots. The dsDNA is kept in storage aliquots at -20 °C, with a single working aliquot being kept at 4 °C to limit freeze-thaw cycles.
- For any drugs or compounds to be tested, these are stored at -20 °C in 100% DMSO (or other solvent if DMSO is not suitable) at 50 mM or less if not soluble at this concentration. In all assays where compounds are being tested, DMSO is included in all samples at a final concentration of 5% at the time of nucleoprotein filament formation, even for compounds that are formulated in water and not DMSO (e.g. chloroquine).
- The procedure below is for testing the effects of compounds on D-loop formation. For assays in which drugs are not being tested, simply omit the steps involving handling of compounds and make up reactions without DMSO.

### Procedure
1. Prepare dilutions of compounds in their storage solvent (usually 100% DMSO) to 20X their final concentration at the time of nucleoprotein filament formation.
1. Prepare a 5X D-loop reaction buffer master mix:

Item | Conc. units | Stock conc. | Master mix conc. | Final conc.
:--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---:
HEPES-NaOH pH 7.2 | mM | 1000 | 125 | 25
ATP | mM | 100 | 5 | 1
MgCl<sub>2</sub> | mM | 100 | 5 | 1
TCEP or DTT | 100 | 5 | 1
BSA | μg/ml | 6600 | 500 | 100

1. Prepare a 10X dilution of recombinase protein in appropriate protein dilution buffer.
	- For HsRAD51, this is a 15 μM dilution made in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, for a final HsRAD51 concentration of 1.5 μM at the time of dsDNA addition.
1. Prepare a 10X dilution of labeled ssDNA in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for a final concentration of 20 nM at the time of D-loop formation.
1. Prepare a 10X dilution of supercoiled plasmid dsDNA in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 for a final concentration of 5 nM at the time of D-loop formation.
1. Prepare master mixes of reaction buffer, water, and protein buffer ± recombinase. Each reaction at the time of D-loop formation will have the composition listed in the table below:

Item | Amount per reaction | Part of master mix
:--- | ---: | :---:
5X D-loop reaction buffer | 2 μl | Y
10X recombinase or buffer | 1 μl | Y
Ultrapure water | 3 μl† | Y
4.5X compound in 22.5% DMSO | 2 μl |
10X labeled ssDNA | 1 μl |
10X supercoiled dsDNA | 1 μl |

† 5 μl if not testing compounds.

1. To the compound dilutions in 100% DMSO above, add 3.44 volumes of water so that the compounds are now at 4.5X their final concentration at the time of nucleoprotein filament formation. This will also bring the DMSO concentration in the dilutions to 22.5%, which is 4.5X the final concentration of 5% at the time of nucleoprotein filament formation. If the compounds were made in water instead of DMSO, then dilute them to 4.5X using water + 22.5% DMSO so that all reactions contain the same amount of DMSO regardless of what compound is being tested.
1. Pre-incubate compounds with RAD51 in reaction buffer: combine
