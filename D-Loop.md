# D-loop Assay
Adapted from protocol by Yuen-Ling Chan (University of Chicago)
___
## Overview
The D-loop assay detects homologous strand invasion catalyzed by recombinase proteins such as RecA and RAD51. A labeled oligonucleotide (e.g. a 90-mer with a 5' Cy5 or <sup>32</sup>P label)

## Gel Preparation
- Make gels and buffers the day of use.
- If using autoclaved glassware, rinse it with deionized water to remove any residue from the autoclave.
- Prepare a single stock of 1X TAE buffer sufficient for all gels and electrophoresis tanks.
	- The TAE buffer used in this assay is different from the Sambrook et al recipe: the final pH of the 1X solution is 7.5 and the conductivity is XX μS/μs.
	- If using the medium-size gel rigs, make 90 ml for one gel (up to 20 lanes), 190 ml for two gels (up to 40 lanes), and 690 ml for each electrophoresis tank, plus some dead volume.
- Prepare 0.9% agarose 1X TAE gels: boil in microwave for 2:30 min (1 gel) or 3:30 min (2 gels), add Milli-Q water to replace any evaporated volume, cool to 45 - 55 °C, and pour 90 ml into each casting tray. Cover loosely to protect from dust.

## Reaction Setup
### Materials And Reagents
- Plastics: Avoid using anything that has been autoclaved. The residue from the autoclave can inhibit many biochemical reactions. Use regular DNAse-free RNAse-free low-adhesion polypropylene tubes and tips.
- Recombinase proteins: These should be stored in single-use aliquots at -80 °C that have undergone no more than three total freeze-thaw cycles.
- The supercoiled dsDNA plasmid target is CsCl-purified plasmid from _E. coli_. There should be no more than 5% nicked plasmid in the preparation.
- Store ATP, TCEP/DTT, BSA, and ssDNA at -20 °C in aliquots. The dsDNA is kept in storage aliquots at -20 °C, with a single working aliquot being kept at 4 °C to limit freeze-thaw cycles.
