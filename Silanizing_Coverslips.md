# Cleaning And Silanizing Glass Coverslips
By Brian Budke
___
## Overview
The first part of this procedure produces very clean glass surfaces. Most commonly, glass prepared in this way is used in silanization procedures. Piranha solution works by completely destroying organic residues on glass surfaces, resulting in a clean surface that can be used in sensitive downstream applications.

Piranha solution is very dangerous. It is extremely corrosive, being both a strong acid and strong oxidizer. Upon mixing, it becomes extremely hot. It can attack metal and will attack pretty much every carbon-based molecule except for Teflon, so the only things that are allowed to come into contact with piranha solution are glass, water, and Teflon. Piranha solution reacts vigorously upon contact with organic compounds, producing bubbles and heat. If anything more than trace amounts of organic compound comes into contact with piranha solution, say a few drops of acetone leftover from a previous cleaning step, the solution will react violently and may explode. For this reason, it is especially important to take every caution to ensure that organic solvents are completely eliminated before treatment with piranha solution. This protocol uses a water jacket at 60 - 70 °C around the beaker of piranha solution during the mixing and cleaning step to control the rate of reaction.

The cleaned glass is then used for silanization. For this protocol 7-octenylmethoxysilane is used as an example, but this procedure should work in principle for any silane. Silanization is done in the liquid phase, though vapor phase silanization can also be performed in an evacuated desiccator, with the benefit of generating far less organic waste. Silanes are extremely sensitive to water, so care should be taken to completely remove any residual water on the surface to be treated and to protect the stock vial from ambient humidity. Silanes are also susceptible to oxidation from atmospheric oxygen, so the contents of the stock vial should be stored under argon if it is available. A quick way to check if a glass surface is indeed coated with silane is to dip it in and out of water; a silanized surface will come out completely dry with no beads or droplets sticking to the glass surface.

## Initial Cleaning
### Materials And Reagents
- Acetone
- 95% or 100% ethanol
- Teflon coverslip rack
- Tall 500 ml beaker
- 1-2 250 ml beakers
- 18.2 MΩ water source
- Sonicator bath (e.g. Branson 2800 ultrasonic bath) and clamps, wires, etc to suspend the tall beaker in the water

### Procedure
1. Place coverslips in a Teflon coverslip rack, and then place this into a tall 500 ml beaker. Fill the beaker with enough acetone to cover the coverslips in the rack. Attach some clamps and wires to this so that the beaker can be suspended into the sonicator water bath without touching the bottom or sides (be creative). Sonicate for 20 minutes.
1. Wash 10 times with 18.2 MΩ water. It's easy to do this quickly next to the water source, using two beakers, filling one with water, transferring the coverslips on the rack to that beaker, dumping out the water in the beaker they were just in, and repeating for 10 washes.
1. Transfer the coverslips to the tall beaker, fill with enough ethanol to cover the coverslips, and sonicate for 20 minutes as above.
1. Wash 10 times with 18.2 MΩ water as above. It is crucial to remove all traces of ethanol. Stopping point: slides can be kept the covered beaker with water.

## Piranha Cleaning
### Materials And Reagents
- 96% sulfuric acid
- 30% hydrogen peroxide in water
- 18.2 MΩ water
- Teflon-coated forceps
- 100 ml beaker, thoroughly rinsed with 18.2 MΩ water
- Glass rod, thoroughly rinsed with 18.2 MΩ water
- 2000 ml beaker
- Thermometer
- Hot plate
- Appropriate PPE (heavy lab coat, heavy gloves, face shield)

### Procedure
1. Add 300 ml of water to the 2000 ml beaker and place on the hot plate in the chemical fume hood. Heat to 60 - 70 °C (dial position 3 on a Corning PC-351 hot plate).
1. Transfer the washed coverslips to the washed 100 ml beaker. Measure 38.5 ml of sulfuric acid in a graduated cylinder and add this to the beaker. Transfer the beaker to the larger beaker with the water at 60 - 70 °C, making sure that the water level in the large beaker isn't so high that the smaller beaker with the acid and coverslips floats away.
1. Slowly add 16.5 ml of the hydrogen peroxide to the beaker with the sulfuric acid and coverslips. Wear appropriate PPE and keep the hood sash between your face and the piranha solution. Mix gently but completely with a clean glass rod; the two phases will not want to mix at first but keep stirring and they will eventually mix. As the phases mix, the solution will heat up and bubbles will form. Allow the piranha solution to clean the glass slides for an hour. After that, remove the piranha solution from the water jacket, transfer the coverslips and rack to a 250 ml beaker full of 18.2 MΩ water using the Teflon forceps, and let the piranha solution cool.
1. Dispose of cooled piranha solution by bringing the volume to 1000 ml and slowly adding an equinormal amount of NaOH pellets (55.1 g), taking care not to let the solution get too hot (e.g., do this in an ice water jacket). Check the pH with an indicator strip; it should be neutral or alkaline. Let the solution cool and then pour it down the drain with copious amounts of tap water. This disposal procedure should only be used for volumes of piranha solution less than 100 ml.

## Post-Cleaning And Drying
### Materials And Reagents
- 0.1 N KOH
- 18.2 MΩ water
- Oven for drying glassware

### Procedure
1. Wash 10 times with 18.2 MΩ water as above.
1. Incubate the coverslips in 0.1 N KOH for 10 minutes to remove any traces of the piranha solution.
1. Wash 10 times with 18.2 MΩ water as above.
1. Thoroughly dry the coverslips in the Teflon rack in the beaker. This can be done by placing the loosely-covered beaker in a hybridization oven (or any suitable oven) at 60 - 80 °C overnight with the door slightly ajar.

## Silanization
### Materials And Reagents
- n-heptane
- 7-octenyltrimethoxysilane
- Desiccator with active Drierite

### Procedure
1. In a 250 ml beaker, mix 100 ml n-heptane and 100 μl of 7-octenyl silane for a solution of 0.1% v/v silane.
1. Transfer the throughly-dried coverslips to the beaker containing n-heptane and silane. Place the beaker in a desiccator containing active Drierite and allow the silanization to proceed overnight.
1. Transfer the coverslips in their rack to a clean dry beaker and allow the organic solvent to completely evaporate in the hood. Dispose of silanization solution according to institutional guidelines; never pour it down the sink as it is extremely bad for the environment.
1. Store coverslips at room temperature protected from light and dust.
