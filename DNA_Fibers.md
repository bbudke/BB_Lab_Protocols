# DNA Fiber Assay
Adapted from protocol by Jennie Mason (Clemson University)
___
## Cell Culture (Day -1)
- Seed cells into a 12-well plate at a sufficient density so that they are ~ 50% confluent by tomorrow. This is usually 50,000 to 150,000 cells per well in a 12-well plate, seeded 20-24 hours before labeling. **_It is very important that cells are happy and growing prior to labeling. Do not use unhappy cells that seem to be growing sluggishly, cells that are less than 40% confluent, or more than 80% confluent._**
