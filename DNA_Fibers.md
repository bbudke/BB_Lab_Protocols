# DNA Fiber Assay
Adapted from protocol by Jennie Mason (Clemson University)
___
## Cell Culture (Day -1)
- Seed cells into a 12-well plate in a total volume of 1.0 ml and at a sufficient density so that they are ~ 50% confluent by tomorrow. This is usually 50,000 to 250,000 cells per well in a 12-well plate, seeded 20-24 hours before labeling.
	- I always seed cells and maintain them in antibiotic-free medium for this experiment.
- **_It is very important that cells are happy and growing prior to labeling. Do not use unhappy cells that seem to be growing sluggishly, cells that are less than 40% confluent, or more than 80% confluent. Throw the plate(s) out, re-seed new ones at an optimized density, and try again. This assay is just too time-consuming and labor-intensive to waste on unhappy cell cultures._**

## Labeling And Drug Treatment (Day 1)
### Reagents
- Nucleotide analogs
	- CldU is dissolved in filtered water to 2500 μM, aliquotted, and stored ≤ -20 °C.
	- IdU is dissolved in filtered water to 5000 μM, aliquotted, and stored ≤ -20 °C.
	- Warm up nucleotide analogs in a 37 °C water bath prior to use. The IdU may need to be heated in a 65 °C water bath for a few minutes to get it all into solution.
	- CldU is added to a final concentration of 20 μM and IdU is added to a final concentration of 50 μM. These concentrations can be modified, but keep in mind that high concentrations of either can slow or stall forks (remember, the cells need to be happily growing right up to the point of HU addition in order to get decent resection of nascent DNA in cell lines where this is expected to occur). Another good reason to limit analog concentrations is that upon exposure to light the analogs can cause strand breakage in DNA.
	- **_Keep nucleotide analogs protected from light. Work in the biosafety cabinet with the light off and protect samples from light from the time that the nucleotide analogs are added to the end of the experiment. Brief exposure to room lights is okay during handling._**
- Drugs and compounds
	- HU is stored dry at room temperature. On the morning of use, dissolve a few milligrams (as needed) in filtered water to a final concentration of 100 mM.
	- Dissolve Mirin to 50 mM in 100% DMSO and store at -20 °C.
	- Mirin is typically used at a final concentration of 50 μM.
	- If Mirin or other DMSO-soluble compound is added to tissue culture medium, bring the DMSO concentration in the medium to 0.1% for all samples, or to up to 0.5% for all samples if higher concentrations of compound are needed.
- Incubation times
	- Labeling times are based on what works well in U2OS cells. The labeling time should be sufficient to give fibers that are at least 10 μm long, but not so long that they are difficult to capture in one field or don't separate from adjacent fibers. Make sure fibers are sufficiently long so that there is still something to measure following HU stalling and resection.
		- For measuring replication fork restart after stalling, the incubation time with the second label is increased to 45 minutes in order to allow time for stalled forks to restart and then replicate a sufficient length of nascent DNA to measure. This time can be adjusted if necessary.
	- A 5-hour incubation time in 4 mM HU is standard for monitoring MRE11-dependent resection of nascent DNA. Some investigators have also used a 3-hour incubation time for this purpose. An 8-hour incubation allows detection of DNA2-dependent, MRE11-independent resection of nascent DNA.

### Labeling Options
- CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU )
	- _Choose this option if you want to examine resection of nascent DNA using a single color or if you want to examine fork restart and new origin firing after stalling with HU_

- CldU → IdU ( → HU )
	- _Choose this option if you only want to examine resection of nascent DNA using the ratio of IdU to CldU._

### Procedure
1. Add the first label (CldU).
	- To the medium already in each well, add 0.5 ml of warm medium containing CldU for a final concentration of 20 μM. Incubate for 30 minutes if following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) or 20 minutes if following CldU → IdU ( → HU ).
1. Wash 2X with warm PBS or warm medium. Work quickly.
1. Add HU, second label (IdU), or stop:
	- If following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) and adding HU:
		- Add 1.0 ml medium containing 4 mM HU and any drugs or compound being studied and the vehicle in which they are dissolved. Incubate for 5 hours.
	- If following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) and **_not_** adding HU:
		- Proceed to Collect cells step.
	- If following CldU → IdU ( → HU ):
		- Add 1.0 ml medium containing 50 μM IdU. Incubate for 20 minutes.
1. Add second label (IdU), HU, or stop:
	- If following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) and HU was added in the last step:
		- Wash 2X with warm PBS or warm medium, working quickly.
		- Add 1.0 ml medium containing 50 μM IdU and any drugs or compound being studied and the vehicle in which they are dissolved. Incubate for 45 minutes.
	- If following CldU → IdU ( → HU ) and adding HU:
		- Add 1.0 ml medium containing 4 mM HU and any drugs or compound being studied and the vehicle in which they are dissolved. Incubate for 5 hours.
	- If following CldU → IdU ( → HU ) and adding **_not_** HU:
		- Proceed to Collect cells step.

## DNA Spreading
### Overview
The goal is to have enough cells spread and attached to the microscope slide so that there are at least a dozen or so fiber spreads per slide, but not so crowded that many fiber spreads are running into each other. A density of 200 cells per μl is a good starting point for most cell lines. Ideally, individual fiber spreads should come from individual cells and be well-separated from each other. Some cell lines may be over-spread even at 200 cells per μl; in that case, it is beneficial to mix in an equal amount (or more) of unlabeled cells so that spreads from labeled cells are better-separated from each other.

### Supplies And Reagents
- Glass microscope slides and long coverslips
	- Using a diamond-tip pen, write the date and slide number at the end of each slide.
	- Briefly rinse each slide with 70% ethanol and wipe dry with a Kimwipe.
- Lysis buffer (make fresh on day of use)
	- 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5
	- 50 mM EDTA, pH 8
	- 0.5 % SDS

### Procedure
1. Collect cells:
	- Remove any media or PBS from the well and add ~ 1 ml *cold* PBS.
	- Remove the cold PBS and add a few drops of cold trypsin-EDTA solution to each well. Incubate for 5 minutes at 37 °C or until cells detach. Monitor detachment by eye; do not use the microscope as this will shine a bright light on your light-sensitive samples.
	- Add a few drops of *cold* complete medium to each well. Transfer each well's contents to a 1.5 ml tube on ice and spin down in a clinical centrifuge for 3 minutes at 500 G.
	- Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 ml *cold* PBS or a volume that you think will give about 200 cells per μl. Count the cells in each sample using the hemocytometer (the counts do not need to be very accurate). Dilute or concentrate each sample to about 200 cells per μl. Keep samples on ice and covered when not in use.
1. Lyse cells and spread DNA onto glass slides:
	- Perform this step in groups of up to eight slides so that you have enough time to work on each sample. For each slide, place a pair of 2 μl drops of cell suspension at the top (close to the frosted end) of the slide. Allow the drops to partially dry until they look flat and slightly tacky. _Do not allow the spots to over-dry._ When a spot appears to have dried to the right point, add a 10 μl drop of lysis buffer to each drop of cells and incubate 2-3 minutes at room temperature. The spots will reach this point at different times, hence the reason for doing this step in batches of no more than eight slides. After the 2-3 minute incubation, tilt the slide 15 - 20 ° by placing one end of it on an Eppendorf tube rack and allow the drops of lysate to run to the bottom. Blot away excess lysate at the bottom of the slide by tapping it onto a paper towel.
1. Allow the slides to dry protected from light for at least 30 minutes. They can be dried overnight if need be.
