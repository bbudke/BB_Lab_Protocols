# DNA Fiber Assay
Adapted from protocol by Jennie Mason (Clemson University)
___
## Cell Culture (Day -1)
- Seed cells into a 12-well plate in a total volume of 1.0 ml and at a sufficient density so that they are ~ 50% confluent by tomorrow. This is usually 50,000 to 250,000 cells per well in a 12-well plate, seeded 20-24 hours before labeling.
	- I always seed cells and maintain them in antibiotic-free medium for this experiment.
- **_It is very important that cells are happy and growing prior to labeling. Do not use unhappy cells that seem to be growing sluggishly, cells that are less than 40% confluent, or more than 80% confluent. Throw the plate(s) out, re-seed new ones at an optimized density, and try again. This assay is just too time-consuming and labor-intensive to waste on unhappy cell cultures._**

## Labeling And Drug Treatment (Day 1)
### Reagents
- Nucleotide analogs
	- CldU is dissolved in filtered water to 2500 μM, aliquotted, and stored ≤ -20 °C.
	- IdU is dissolved in filtered water to 5000 μM, aliquotted, and stored ≤ -20 °C.
	- Warm up nucleotide analogs in a 37 °C water bath prior to use. The IdU may need to be heated in a 65 °C water bath for a few minutes to get it all into solution.
	- CldU is added to a final concentration of 20 μM and IdU is added to a final concentration of 50 μM. These concentrations can be modified, but keep in mind that high concentrations of either can slow or stall forks (remember, the cells need to be happily growing right up to the point of HU addition in order to get decent resection of nascent DNA in cell lines where this is expected to occur). Another good reason to limit analog concentrations is that upon exposure to light the analogs can cause strand breakage in DNA.
	- **_Keep nucleotide analogs protected from light. Work in the biosafety cabinet with the light off and protect samples from light from the time that the nucleotide analogs are added to the end of the experiment. Brief exposure to room lights is okay during handling._**
- Drugs and compounds
	- HU is stored dry at room temperature. On the morning of use, dissolve a few milligrams (as needed) in filtered water to a final concentration of 100 mM.
	- Dissolve Mirin to 50 mM in 100% DMSO and store at -20 °C.
	- Mirin is typically used at a final concentration of 50 μM.
	- If Mirin or other DMSO-soluble compound is added to tissue culture medium, bring the DMSO concentration in the medium to 0.1% for all samples, or to up to 0.5% for all samples if higher concentrations of compound are needed.
- Incubation times
	- Labeling times are based on what works well in U2OS cells. The labeling time should be sufficient to give fibers that are at least 10 μm long, but not so long that they are difficult to capture in one field or don't separate from adjacent fibers. Make sure fibers are sufficiently long so that there is still something to measure following HU stalling and resection.
	- A 5-hour incubation time in 4 mM HU is standard for monitoring MRE11-dependent resection of nascent DNA. Some investigators have also used a 3-hour incubation time for this purpose. An 8-hour incubation allows detection of DNA2-dependent, MRE11-independent resection of nascent DNA.

### Labeling Options
- CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU )
	- _Choose this option if you want to examine resection of nascent DNA using a single color or if you want to examine fork restart and new origin firing after stalling with HU_

- CldU → IdU ( → HU )
	- _Choose this option if you only want to examine resection of nascent DNA using the ratio of IdU to CldU._

### Procedure
1. Add the first label (CldU).
	- To the medium already in each well, add 0.5 ml of warm medium containing CldU for a final concentration of 20 μM. Incubate for 30 minutes if following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) or 20 minutes if following CldU → IdU ( → HU ).
2. Wash 2X with warm PBS or warm medium. Work quickly.
3. Add HU, second label, or stop:
	- If following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) and adding HU:
		- Add 1.0 ml medium containing 4 mM HU and any drugs or compound being studied and the vehicle in which they are dissolved.
	- If following CldU ( → HU ) ( → IdU ) and **_not_** adding HU:
		- Proceed to Collect Cells step.
	- If following CldU → IdU ( → HU ):
		- Add 1.0 ml medium containing 50 μM IdU. Incubate for 20 minutes.
