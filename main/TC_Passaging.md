# Passaging Adherent Cell Cultures
By Brian Budke

## Overview
This protocol covers one of the most basic elements of tissue cell culture, which the maintenance of cell cultures in a state of steady constant growth. Cells are always grown in a subconfluent state; if they become confluent, then their growth characteristics will be altered for a number of reasons including nutrient starvation, waste build-up, and contact inhibition. Conversely, if cells are maintained at too low a density, then their growth may slow down or stop altogether due to a lack of cross-feeding by neighboring cells. Therefore, it is important to maintain cell cultures at the right density throughout routine culturing so that the cells behave in a reproducible manner when it comes time to use them for experiments. Most cell lines grow well when seeded to 10 - 20% confluence and passaged when they reach 70 - 80% confluence. Finally, cell lines should be kept in continuous culture for no longer than one month, as they can accumulate mutations over time leading to unreproducible experimental results.

The cost passaging a single culture is relatively small, but adds up over time. Maintain cell cultures in the smallest vessel needed to get enough cells for a particular assay. Generally, a single 6-cm dish of cells at 70% confluence is fine if less than 10<sup>6</sup> cells are needed for a particular experiment, and one or more 10-cm dishes if more cells are required. Cells should be kept in culture only for as long as they are going to be needed for experiments. If there are no plans to use a particular cell culture in the coming week, then toss it.

Routine cell culture activity should be kept in a log or journal. It is convenient to keep track of this activity in an Excel spreadsheet or CSV table. Keeping an electronic log also makes it easy to track the growth of cell cultures and make note of any abnormalities that may arise.

## Protocol
### Materials And Reagents
- Plastics: All liquid handling should be done in sterile low-adhesion polypropylene tubes using sterile barrier pipette tips or individually-wrapped cotton-plugged serological pipettes. Do not use autoclaved plastics.
- TC-treated culture dishes
- Complete medium, warmed to 37 °C
- PBS, warmed to 37 °C
- Trypsin-EDTA, warmed to room temperature
- Vacuum trap and autoclaved pasteur pipettes
- Swinging-bucket clinical centrifuge

### Procedure
1. Visually estimate the percent confluence of the culture.
1. Aspirate the medium, wash the adherent cells once with PBS, and aspirate the wash.
1. Add just enough trypsin-EDTA to cover the growth surface (0.5 ml for 6-cm dishes, 1.0 ml for 10-cm dishes). Incubate at 37 °C for 1 - 5 minutes, until cells round up and start to detach. Gently shake or tap the dish to dislodge the cells. For stubborn cultures, transfer the trypsin to a conical tube, add fresh trypsin, and repeat the incubation until cells are rounded up and ready to dislodge.
1. Add 1 - 3 volumes of complete medium to the dish, and pipette up and down a few times, rinsing the growth area to completely dislodge and resuspend the cells. Transfer the cell suspension to a conical vial.
1. Spin down for 3 minutes at 500 g.
1. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in a suitable volume of medium, usually 2 - 3 ml.
1. Seed the cell suspension into a clean culture dish with sufficient medium (5 ml total for a 6-cm dish or 10 ml total for a 10-cm dish). Cells should be seeded to at least 20% confluence or even down to 10% if they can tolerate it just as well as 20%.
