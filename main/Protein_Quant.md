# Quantitation Of Protein In Samples
By Brian Budke
___
## Overview
- Multiple procedures for determining protein concentration are provided here. Each one has its own advantages and drawbacks, and in many cases at least one of these methods will be completely unsuitable for a given sample. The two colorimetric methods below are optimized for use in 96-well plates, which are read in a plate reader.

## Method 1: UV Spectroscopy (Nanodrop)
### Advantages
- Very fast
- Sensitive (sample does not need to be diluted into detection reagents before measuring)
- No standard curve needed

### Incompatible With:
- Any molecules in the sample other than protein that also absorb at 280 nm (i.e., all other aromatic organic compounds). This completely precludes the use of this method for measuring protein in cellular extracts.

### Materials And Reagents
- Nanodrop spectrophotometer
- Sample buffer to be used as a blank

### Procedure
1. Use the protein quantitation program on the Nanodrop computer to measure protein concentration in the sample.

## Method 2: Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Modified Bradford)
### Advantages
- Reasonably fast
- Compatible with glycerol and reducing agents typically found in protein storage buffers

### Incompatible With:
- Most detergents at concentrations used in lysis buffers. Samples made in RIPA buffer must be diluted 5 - 10-fold in detergent-free buffer first before adding them to the detection reagent, limiting sensitivity in these samples.

### Materials And Reagents
- Protein Assay Dye 5X Concentrate (Bio-Rad 500-006)
- Sample buffer to be used as a blank/filler; this is the same buffer that the protein samples are made up in (e.g., storage buffer, lysis buffer, etc). If multiple different sample buffers are used, then a standard curve will have to be made for each one.
- BSA standards in water
- Plate reader with 595 nm absorbance filter

### Procedure
1. Prepare enough 1X Protein Assay Dye by diluting the 5X stock in dH<sub>2</sub>O for all the samples, plus an eight-point standard curve (including the blank), plus another 1 - 2 ml extra volume for samples that may need to be repeated. Each sample and point along the standard curve occupies a well in a 96-well plate with 300 μl total volume.
1. Add 280 μl 1X Protein Assay Dye to each well.
1. To each of the eight respective wells that will make up the standard curve: add 10 μl of water ± BSA at 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, or 0.7 mg/ml to each well. Then add 10 μl of sample buffer to each well, mixing by swirling with the pipette tip.
1. To each of the sample wells: add 10 μl water to each well. Then add 10 μl protein sample in sample buffer to each well, mixing by swirling with the pipette tip.
  - The intensity of purple color change upon mixing in the protein sample is proportional to protein concentration.
  - For any sample that ends up darker purple than the highest concentration on the standard curve, make up another well with 280 μl dye, 10 μl water, and a reduced volume of protein sample along with sample buffer to 10 μl total protein + sample buffer.
1. Incubate for 5 minutes at RT.
1. Read absorbance in the plate reader at 595 nm.
1. Calculate the protein concentration in each sample by interpolating from the standard curve.

## Method 3: BCA Assay
### Advantages
- Better compatibility with detergents compared to modified Bradford, making it more suitable for quantifying protein in cellular lysates.

### Incompatible With:
- Reducing agents and glycerol, which makes this assay generally unsuitable for quantifying samples of purified protein as they tend to be stored in buffers containing these reagents.
- High concentrations of detergents.

### Materials And Reagents
- BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce 23227)
- Sample buffer to be used as a blank/filler; this is the same buffer that the protein samples are made up in (e.g., storage buffer, lysis buffer, etc). If multiple different sample buffers are used, then a standard curve will have to be made for each one.
- BSA standards in water
- Plate reader with 550 nm absorbance filter

### Procedure
1. Prepare enough working reagent for each well, which will contain 176.40 μl Reagent A + 3.60 μl Reagent B per well along with 10 μl water ± BSA and 10 μl sample buffer ± protein sample for 200 μl total per well.
1. Add 180 μl working reagent to each well.
1. To each of the nine respective wells that will make up the standard curve: add 10 μl of water ± BSA at 0.0, 0.025, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg/ml to each well. Then add 10 μl of sample buffer to each well, mixing by swirling with the pipette tip.
1. To each of the sample wells: add 10 μl water to each well. Then add 10 μl protein sample in sample buffer to each well, mixing by swirling with the pipette tip.
  - The color change will not be immediately visible except for the most concentrated samples.
  - For any sample that initially appears darker purple than the highest concentration on the standard curve, make up another well with 180 μl dye, 10 μl water, and a reduced volume of protein sample along with sample buffer to 10 μl total protein + sample buffer.
1. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37 °C.
1. Read absorbance in the plate reader at 550 nm.
1. Calculate the protein concentration in each sample by interpolating from the standard curve.
