# Preparation Of Relaxed Closed Circular dsDNA
By Brian Budke
___
### Overview
Negatively-supercoiled plasmid DNA is incubated with topoisomerase I from _E. coli_ to yield covalently closed circular relaxed DNA. When topoisomerase is present in large amounts, positively-supercoiled DNA is also produced. In this protocol, the incubation time and amount of topoisomerase I is optimized for the 4,373 bp pRS306 plasmid.

### Reagents
- Topoisomerase I from _E. coli_
- Topoisomerase I storage buffer
	- 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5
	- 100 mM EDTA
	- 50 mM KCl
	- 35 mM ammonium sulfate
	- 50% glycerol
	- 1 mM DTT
- NEB CutSmart Buffer
	- 20 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.9
	- 50 mM potassium acetate
	- 10 mM magnesium acetate
	- 100 μg/ml BSA
- Supercoiled plasmid DNA
- PCI (phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol at 25:24:1, pH 6.7 with 1 M Tris)
- 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5

### Procedure
1. Prepare a reaction containing 1X NEB CutSmart buffer, 20 ng/μl plasmid, and topoisomerase I. Dilute topoisomerase I in storage buffer as necessary.
	- To make relaxed DNA containing some positively-supercoiled topoisomers, add 2.6 units of topoisomerase per microgram of DNA.
	- To make relaxed DNA containing minimal topoisomers, add 0.1 units of topoisomerase per microgram of DNA.
	- For large-scale preparations, distribute the reaction into 1.5-ml tubes, 500 μl per tube.
1. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 minutes.
1. Stop the reaction by extracting with an equal volume of PCI and transfer the upper aqueous phase to a clean tube.
1. Add sodium acetate pH 5 to 0.3 M, add 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, mix, and spin down at 4 °C for 20 minutes at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge.
1. Resuspend the pellet to ~100 ng/μl in TE buffer and repeat the above ethanol precipitation to remove all traces of phenol.
1. Resuspend the pellet in TE buffer, quantify the DNA concentration, dilute to the desired concentration, and store at 4 °C.
