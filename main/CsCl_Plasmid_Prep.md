# CsCl Purification Of Supercoiled Plasmid DNA
By Yuen-Ling Chan

___
## Plasmid Purification
### Overview
The following protocol is used to purify covelently-closed supercoiled plasmid DNA from _E. coli_ bearing high-copy plasmid. The plasmid produced by this technique can be used in a D-loop assay, for which plasmid purified by the standard alkaline lysis technique is unsuitable given the presence of irreversibly denatured and nicked plasmid in these preps. This technique uses CsCl and ethidium bromide; both of these are potent inhibitors of the D-loop reaction and it is important that they are completely removed from the final prep.

### Materials And Reagents
- _E. coli_ DH5α with high-copy plasmid to be purified
- LB agar plate with appropriate antibiotic
- 10 ml LB medium with appropriate antibiotic in small culture flask
- 2x 1 L LB medium (per 1 L: 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl, to pH 7.2 - 7.4 with NaOH) with appropriate antibiotic in 3 L baffled Fernbach flask
- Resuspension buffer (25% sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
- Lysozyme buffer (freshly-made 20 mg/ml lysozyme, 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
- EDTA solution (250 mM EDTA)
- Lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 62.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)
- 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide
- CsCl
- CsCl blank solution (1.1 g/ml CsCl in 10 mM EDTA)
- Isopropanol saturated with water and CsCl (the isopropanol is in the upper phase)
- 3x 2 L TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA)

### Equipment
- Shaker incubator with room for the Fernbach flasks
- 1 L centrifuge buckets and a floor centrifuge that can spin these down
- Ti70, Ti70.1 rotors and an ultracentrifuge that can spin these rotors
- Ti70 tubes and caps
- Ti70.1 Quick-Seal tubes and sealing equipment
- Pliers
- 5-ml syringe and 16-gauge needles
- Clinical centrifuge
- 12-14 MWCO regenerated cellulose 25 mm flat width dialysis membrane, clips, and foam floater
- Pasteur pipettes, including one that has been briefly flamed at the end so as to smooth the tip so that it doesn't scratch the dialysis membrane
- Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filtration device (optional)

### Procedure (Day 1)
1. Streak out _E. coli_ DH5α containing the plasmid to single colonies on an LB agar plate with the appropriate antibiotic and grow at 37 °C overnight.

### Procedure (Day 2)
1. Pick a single colony and inoculate into the 10 ml LB culture with antibiotic and grow overnight at 37 °C.

### Procedure (Day 3)
1. Subculture 4 ml of the overnight into each of two 1 L LB cultures in Fernbach flasks and grow at 37 °C until OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 to 1.1; about 5 hours.
1. Spin down the cells in 1 L buckets for 30 min at 6,000 g, 4 °C. Pour off all the supernatant, shaking away the last drops.
1. Resuspend each pellet to 4 ml in resuspension buffer (start by adding about 1 ml to each pellet). Be sure to completely resuspend the cells so that there are no clumps. Transfer each 4 ml of cell suspension to a Ti70 centrifuge tube on ice.
1. Add 0.8 ml of lysozyme buffer to each tube, mix well, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
1. Add 1.6 ml of EDTA solution to each tube, mix well, and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
1. Add 6.4 ml of lysis buffer to each tube and mix well to form an evenly-consistent lysate.
1. Spin down in a Ti70 rotor for 40 minutes at 40,000 rpm, 4 °C. Transfer the cleared lysate to a single conical vial.
1. Distribute the cleared supernatant in 5 to 8 ml aliquots into 15-ml conical vials. Add 1.1 g/ml CsCl and mix until completely dissolved.
1. Transfer each aliquot above into a Quick-Seal Ti70.1 tube using a syringe and 16-gauge needle. Fill each tube to 1 cm from the top with CsCl blank solution. Add 180 μl of 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide to each tube using a gel-loading tip. Finally, bring the volume in each tube to 0.5 cm from the top with CsCl blank solution, balancing each tube within <0.01 g of each other. Protect the tubes from light, as ethidium bromide will nick the DNA under illumination.
1. Place a sealing nub on each tube. Hold the heating cylinder in the hottest part of a bunsen burner flame for 5 to 15 seconds using a long forceps, press gently but firmly onto a sealing nub until the stem collapses and the tube is sealed. Repeat for each tube, keeping the sealing nubs on the tubes until they cool, about 5 minutes. Remove the nubs and invert the tubes several times to mix in the ethidium bromide (and to test the seal), place a red cap on each tube, and place the tubes in the Ti70.1 rotor.
1. Spin the Ti70.1 rotor for at least 30 hours at 53,000 rpm, 17 °C.

### Procedure (Day 5)
1. Remove the tubes from the rotor using a pliers. Be careful so as not to disturb the CsCl gradient. Protect from light.
1. Secure the tubes in an upright position. The plasmid DNA will be in the middle of the CsCl gradient, with a fainter band of nicked and linear plasmid running about 1 cm above the thicker band of covalently-closed circular supercoiled plasmid. To pull the band containing the supercoiled plasmid, place a piece of scotch tape over the middle part of the tube where the band is to prevent leaks where the needle is inserted, stick a 16-gauge needle in the top of the tube to equalize the pressure when the band is being pulled (wear eye protection, as some CsCl + EtBr may squirt out), stick a 16-gauge needle attached to a 5-ml syringe bevel-down just below where the supercoiled plasmid band is, rotate the bevel up, and with the end of the needle in the center of the column, _gently_ aspirate the band from below without contaminating it with the nicked plasmid band. The needle used to pull the band may clog when inserted into the tube; if that happens, leave it in place and use another needle and syringe to pull the band. Transfer the pulled band from the syringe into a 15-ml conical vial and repeat for the remaining tubes.
1. Extract the ethidium bromide by adding an equal volume of isopropanol saturated with water and CsCl. Mix the phases well by gently inverting the tube several times and spin down briefly at maximum speed in a clinical centrifuge to separate the phases. Using a pasteur pipette, remove the lower aqueous phase and transfer to a new conical vial. Repeat the extractions until the upper phase no longer has any visible red color and then once more so that all the ethidium bromide is removed. Four extractions is usually enough. After the second extraction it is okay to turn on the room lights. The lower phase may be slightly yellow in color; this is okay and the color goes away with dialysis. Save a small aliquot of the plasmid prep at this point for quantification and gel analysis.
1. Cut a suitable length of dialysis tubing and rinse it thoroughly with 18.2 MΩ water. Clip the tubing at one end and transfer the plasmid prep to the tube without introducing too much air using the flamed pasteur pipette. Clip the other end of the tubing, attach a foam floater and dialyze against two changes of 2 L TE buffer at 4 °C with gentle stirring. The first two rounds of dialysis can be done for as little as 2.5 hours, while the third and last round of dialysis should be done overnight. Save a small aliquot of the plasmid prep after dialysis is complete for quantification and gel analysis.

### Procedure (Day 6)
1. Quantify the DNA concentration in the prep by UV absorbance. If the prep is sufficiently concentrated, then it can be stored as described below. Otherwise, it can be concentrated in an Amicon centrifugal filtration device. Do not concentrate it by ethanol precipitation, as this will cause too much nicking.
1. Aliquot and store the plasmid at -20 °C for long-term storage, or at 4 °C for short to medium-term storage. Avoid freeze-thaw cycles. Run 1 μl of the pre-dialysis and post-dialysis (and post-concentrated, if this was done) samples on a suitable agarose gel to verify plasmid yield and quality.
