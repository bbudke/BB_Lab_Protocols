## Seeding And Treatment Of Cells
### Overview
The purpose of this procedure is to perform cytological examination of adherent cells grown on untreated glass coverslips by immunostaining. Typically, cells are seeded on coverslips 24 hours in advance so that they grow to 50 - 70% confluence. The coverslips are placed in 6-cm dishes or 6-well cluster plates with sufficient growth medium. Then a treatment such as ionizing radiation or a drug is typically administered to the cells grown on the coverslips and the cells are outgrown in or following the treatment for a specified time. At the end of this time, cells are fixed and permeabilized to facilitate immunostaining for proteins of interest by appropriate antibodies. Fluorescent secondary antibodies are typically used to provide a detectable signal by fluorescent light microscopy.

### Materials And Reagents
- 6-well tissue culture plates or 6-cm tissue culture dishes
- 22 x 22 x 2 mm glass coverslips (other sizes can be used as needed; the procedure below assumes that 22 mm square coverslips are being used in 6-well plates)

### Initial Cell Culture
- Set up as many coverslips in individual wells/dishes as needed for the experiment. If the coverslips are initially non-sterile, transfer them to growth chambers as follows: soak your gloved hands with 70% ethanol, rub dry in the hood, and transfer coverslips to growth chambers one at a time, handling them at the edges. Then leave the plates with the coverslips in the TC hood with the lids off, close the sash, turn on the UV lamp, and irradiate them for 30 minutes to kill any germs on the coverslips.
- Seed the growth chambers with coverslips to the appropriate density with trypsinized and washed growing cells so that they reach the desired confluence in the next day. If siRNA knockdown is performed, it is appropriate to do this 24 hours before re-plating the cells onto coverslips.

### Treatment
- If cells are to be treated with drugs, add a volume of medium containing the vehicle ± the drug and incubate the cells with the drug as needed.
- If radiation is being administered:
	- Take the dishes of cells down to the warmed-up Philips RT250 Maxitron, including the control plate that receives 0 Gy. Use a disinfected styrofoam or plastic box to transport the cells.
	- Check that the 10 cm<sup>2</sup> cone and 1 mm Cu filter are installed. Set the distance from the end of the cone to the table to 10 cm.
	- Irradiate the respective plates for the time indicated in the table on the wall near the control panel. The dose rate is about 1.54 Gy/min with the above configuration.
	- Return the cells to the TC incubator and outgrow as needed.
- At the end of treatment and outgrowth, proceed to the fixation, permeabilization, and immunostaining procedure below.

## Fixation, Permeabilization, And Immunostaining
### Materials And Reagents
- Fixative solution:
	- 3.0% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA)
	- 3.4% sucrose
	- 1X PBS
	- To make the solution, add the PFA dry powder to the PBS in a clean screw-cap glass bottle and leave it in the 50 °C water bath for a few hours, swirling occasionally until all the PFA is dissolved. Then add sucrose, cool the solution to room temperature, 0.2 μm-filter, and chill to 0 - 4 °C. If you are in a hurry, the PFA can be dissolved within 20-30 minutes by stirring the PFA + PBS mixture on a hot plate until dissolved; in that case, use a thermometer to monitor the temperature and do not allow the temperature to exceed 70 °C.
	- The fixative solution is used at 0 - 4 °C and can be stored for up to a week at 4 °C.
- Permeabilization buffer:
	- 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4
	- 50 mM NaCl
	- 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>
	- 300 mM sucrose (from 0.2 μm-filtered stock)
	- 0.5% Triton X-100
	- Permeabilization buffer is made fresh the day of use.
- Blocking buffer:
	- 1% BSA
	- 1X PBS

### Procedure
1. Remove the media from each well.
1. Wash coverslips in each well with 1 ml PBS for 5 minutes at RT.
1. Add 1 ml ice-cold fixative solution to each well and incubate for 10 minutes at RT.
	- Note: the order of Steps 3 and 5 can be switched so that permeabilization is carried out before fixation. This is referred to as the "pre-extraction" method, which removes much of the soluble protein from the cell before it can be fixed by the paraformaldehyde. Some antibody-epitope pairs benefit from this method, as much of the background from soluble protein is removed at the expense of overall signal intensity.
	- Aldehyde fixation followed by detergent permeabilization works for most but not all of the antibodies that we use. If this fixation/permeabilization strategy does not yield good results, other methods should be tried. An alternative method is to incubate cells at this point in 100% methanol that has been chilled to -20 °C for 10 minutes at -20 °C. This simultaneously fixes and permeabilizes cells and is typically used in the lab for PCNA staining. If methanol fixation is carried out, it replaces Steps 3 through 5 in this procedure.
1. Wash coverslips in each well 3 times with 1 ml PBS for 5 minutes at RT.
1. Gently add 1 ml permeabilization buffer to each well and incubate for 10 minutes at RT.
1. Wash coverslips in each well 3 times with 1 ml PBS for 5 minutes at RT.
1. Add 1 ml blocking buffer to each well and incubate for 15 minutes at RT or longer at 4 °C.
	- Stopping point: samples can be held at this stage for up to a few days at 4 °C. Be sure to wrap plates in parafilm or take other precautions to minimize evaporation of the buffer during long holding periods.
1. Prepare a damp chamber consisting of a Pyrex dish with an inverted long gel casting tray placed inside and a few millimeters of water at the bottom of the dish. Place two strips of Parafilm on top of the inverted gel casting tray and press flat so that the strips are stuck to the plastic tray with no bumps or wrinkles. Transfer coverslips one at a time to the Parafilm strips, cell side up, and add 100 μl of blocking solution with diluted primary antibody. Incubate for the appropriate time at the appropriate temperature (18 hours at 4 °C works for most antibodies).
1. Transfer coverslips to 6-well plates with 1 ml PBS per well and wash coverslips in each well 3 times with 1 ml PBS for 5 minutes at RT.
1. Transfer coverslips back into the cleaned damp chamber with fresh Parafilm strips and incubate with 100 μl blocking buffer with diluted secondary antibody as above for 1 hour at RT.
1. Transfer coverslips to 6-well plates with 1 ml PBS per well and wash coverslips in each well 3 times with 1 ml PBS for 5 minutes at RT.
1. Air-dry the coverslips.
1. Mount coverslips onto glass slides in appropriate anti-fade mounting medium:
	- Vectashield H-1200 (with DAPI) is used for routine cytology experiments.
	- Glass slides should be cleaned before use by washing with soap and hot water and then rubbing dry with 100% ethanol and a Kimwipe.
	- Place a 11 μl drop of mounting medium near one end of the slide.
	- Mount a coverslip on top of the drop with the cells face-down, pressing firmly and taking care not to move it from side to side.
	- Repeat the above two steps to mount a second coverslip on the other half of the slide.
	- Blot and wipe away excess Vectashield with a Kimwipe.
	- Seal the edges of the coverslip with clear nail polish.
	- Mounted and sealed samples can be kept for many months at 4 °C protected from light.
1. Acquire images on the scope.
1. Use the [BB Macros](https://github.com/bbudke/BB_macros) set for [NIH ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) to automatically score foci.
