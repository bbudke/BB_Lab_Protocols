# VenorGem Mycoplasma Detection Assay
Adapted from kit manufacturer's protocol.
___
## Overview
This assay uses proprietary, commercially available reagents to detect mycoplasma in tissue culture media supernatants by PCR. This is a modified version of the protocol provided by Sigma that uses less of the primer-dNTP mix, which is the limiting component of the kit. The assay is still sufficiently sensitive to detect the positive control DNA with the same intensity as the original manufacturer's protocol.

Mycoplasma tests should be performed at least monthly on all cultures that are currently up. Testing should also be performed on any new cell line that arrives at the lab, as soon as it is brought up into culture.

## Gel Preparation
- Prepare a 1.5% agarose 0.5X TBE gel with sufficient 0.5X TBE running buffer. Before pouring the gel, add ethidium bromide to 0.2 μg/ml to the molten gel and mix in. Also include 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide in the running buffer.

## Reaction Setup
### Materials And Reagents
- Plastics: Avoid using anything that has been autoclaved. The residue from the autoclave can inhibit many biochemical reactions. Use regular DNAse-free RNAse-free low-adhesion polypropylene tubes and tips. Always use sterile barrier tips when handling cell culture supernatants and PCR reagents.
- VenorGem kit (Sigma MP0025)
- 2 mM dNTPs
- Clontech 50X Titanium Taq

### Procedure
- Collect 20 μl of supernatant medium from each culture to be tested.
	- Ideally, media supernatants should come from cultures that have not had a media change in at least two days and are 50 - 80% confluent.
- Boil each sample in a water bath for 5 minutes.
- Centrifuge the samples at maximum speed in a microfuge for 1 minute to pellet debris. When adding samples to the PCR tubes below, draw the sample close to the meniscus.
- Prepare a master mix of the following:

Item | μl per reaction
:--- | ---:
18.2 MΩ (Or PCR-Grade) Water | 9.00
VenorGem 10X PCR Buffer | 1.50
VenorGem dNTPs And Primers | 0.50
2 mM dNTPs | 1.00
VenorGem Internal Control DNA | 1.50
Clontech 50X Titanium Taq | 0.30

- For each sample and the positive and negative controls, transfer 1.2 μl into a PCR tube with 13.8 μl master mix on ice for 15 μl total per reaction.
- Run the samples in a thermal cycler with the following program, placing tubes in the block once it reaches 95 °C:

Step | Action
:---: | :---
1 | 95 °C for 5 minutes
2 | 95 °C for 30 seconds
3 | 55 °C for 1 minute
4 | 72 °C for 30 seconds
5 | Repeat steps 2-4 for 39 total cycles
6 | 72 °C for 5 minutes

- Load 5 μl of each reaction on the agarose gel.
- Run the gel at 5 V/cm for 50 minutes or until the bromophenol blue is 2/3 the way to the bottom.
- Photograph the gel under UV transillumination.

## Gel Interpretation
- All sample lanes should contain a 191 bp band. This is the internal control band that shows that the PCR actually worked.
- Any sample that has even a slight band in the 267-277 bp range is contaminated with mycoplasma.
	- If this band also appears in the negative control, one or more of the PCR reagents or plastics are contaminated. If 18.2 MΩ water is being used, try getting a new aliquot.
	- If a sample is heavily-infected with mycoplasma, the 191 bp internal control band may be faint or absent, as mycoplasma DNA in the sample outcompetes the internal control template DNA.
