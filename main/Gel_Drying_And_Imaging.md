# Gel Drying And Imaging For Radioactive Gels
Protocol by Yuen-Ling Chan (University of Chicago)
___
## Overview
This protocol is used to dry wet agarose gels containing radiolabeled DNA so that the signal can be detected by phosphorimaging. The gels are dried on top of a positively-charged nylon filter to capture any short labeled DNA fragments that may escape from the gel during vacuum drying.

## Materials And Equipment
- Whatman 3MM filter paper or any thick chromatography paper.
- Positively-charged nylon membrane. We routinely use Amersham Hybond N+ 0.45 μm nylon membrane (GE Healthcare cat. no. RPN303B).
- Vacuum gel dryer.

## Procedure
1. Remove the gel from the electrophoresis tank and rinse thoroughly with distilled water.
1. Place the gel in a sandwich consisting of the following, from bottom to top:
	- Glass plate
	- Four to six layers of paper towels
	- One layer of Whatman paper
	- The wet gel, placed upside down
	- Nylon filter, placed on top of the upside down gel without trapping any bubbles
	- One layer of Whatman paper
	- Four to six layers of paper towels
	- Glass plate
1. Flip the sandwich over, place a 1 - 2 kg weight on top, and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Toss the rest of the sandwich components in the radioactive dry waste.
1. Remove the gel, nylon filter, and bottom sheet of Whatman paper from the sandwich and place right side up on the vacuum dryer. Cover with a single layer of PVC film and dry under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 hour or until dry.
1. Expose the dried gel to a phosphor screen overnight.
1. Scan the phosphor plate on any suitable phosphorimager. Ideally, the brightest pixels should be 80% saturated. If there are any saturated pixels in any region to be quantified, re-expose the gel for a shorter time and scan again.
