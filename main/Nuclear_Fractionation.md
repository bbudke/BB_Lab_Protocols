# Preparation Of Fractionated Protein Extracts From Cultured Tissue Cells
By Brian Budke
___
## Overview
- In this procedure, cells are first lysed in hypotonic buffer with a weak detergent to make an extract containing soluble cytoplasmic proteins and intact nuclei. This cytosolic fraction is saved, and the nuclei are then lysed in buffer containing SDS to release soluble nuclear protein. Any material that can be pelleted after this step are likely to be tightly-bound chromatin proteins, which can be solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer.
- This procedure assumes that cells to be lysed have been grown to 70% confluence in 6-well cluster plates. This typically provides at least 50 μg of total protein per well, though some cells lines like U2OS have lower yields. The amounts of reagent used here should be scaled according to the volume of the intact cell pellet. About 1/3 of the total soluble protein will be in the nuclear compartment and 2/3 will be in the cytosol.

## Lysis Buffers
- Hypotonic buffer:
	- 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4
	- 10 mM KCl
	- 1.5 mM MgCl

- 10% NP-40 (IGEPAL CA-630)

- RIPA buffer:
	- 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0
	- 150 mM NaCl
	- 1.0% NP-40 (IGEPAL CA-630)
	- 0.5% sodium deoxycholate
	- 0.1% SDS
	- 1:1000 volume Benzonase (Sigma E1014-25KU)

### Preparation Of Buffers
- As with making [whole cell extracts](WCE.md), lysis buffers are made fresh the day of use with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors if needed. Extra buffer is made so that there is enough for blank samples and filler for gel loading and BCA assay.

## Procedure
### Materials And Reagents
- Cold PBS
- Cell scrapers
- Lysis buffer (made above)

### Procedure
1. Aspirate all the media from the wells, wash each monolayer once with 1 ml cold PBS, and aspirate the wash.
1. Add 500 μl cold PBS to each well. Scrape up the cells in each well with a cell scraper, rotating the plate while scraping to ensure that nothing gets missed.
1. Transfer each cell suspension to a 1.5 ml tube and spin down in a clinical centrifuge at speed 3 (300 x g) for 5 minutes at 4 °C.
	- Up to six 1.5 ml tubes can be stacked into a 50 ml conical vial with no cap and spun down in the conical tube in the clinical centrifuge.
1. Remove the wash supernatant with a P-1000 pipette. If measuring pellet volumes, remove any remaining amount with a P-20 pipette, taking care not to disturb the pellet while removing as much wash as possible.
1. Determine the pellet volume. The pellet volume may be measured with a P-200 pipette by resuspending the pellet in 100 μl PBS and then taking the difference between the amount added and the total volume which includes the pellet. If the pellet volume for a particular cell line grown to 70% confluence in a 6-well is well-known, then that can be used as an estimate. Most cell lines will give 3.5 - 7.5 μl of pellet volume per 70% confluent 6-well.
	- _Optional_: At this point, the cell suspension can be split up to provide a whole cell extract along with the cytosolic and nuclear-fractionated extracts. If a whole cell extract is also desired, transfer 25% of the cell suspension volume to a new tube, spin down as above, and resuspend in 5 - 10 pellet volumes (times the percentage of cell suspension used here) of RIPA buffer. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes, vortex for 10 seconds, spin down at maximum speed in a minifuge at 4 °C for 5 minutes, and save the supernatant into a separate tube.
1. Ensure that only minimal residual PBS remains in the pelleted sample (a P-20 pipette should have been used to remove all the supernatant without disturbing the pellet). Resuspend the pellet in 5 - 10 volumes of hypotonic buffer. Incubate on ice for 20 minutes, add 1:10 volume of 10% NP-40, and vortex for 10 seconds.
1. Spin down in a clinical centrifuge at speed 7 (1800 x g) for 5 minutes at 4 °C. Save the supernatant into a separate tube as the soluble cytosolic fraction. Resuspend the pelleted nuclei in 5 - 10 original pellet volumes of hypotonic buffer and repeat the above spin to re-pellet the nuclei. Discard the wash supernatant.
1. Resuspend the pellet in 3 - 5 original pellet volumes of RIPA buffer. Incubate on ice for 30 minutes and then vortex for 10 seconds. Spin down at maximum speed in a minifuge at 4 °C for 5 minutes, and save the supernatant containing the soluble nuclear fraction into a separate tube.
