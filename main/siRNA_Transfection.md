# siRNA Transfection
Adapted from protocol by Jennie Mason (Clemson University)
___
## Overview
This protocol is used to knock down gene expression in mammalian cells using siRNA. For routine reverse transfections, cells are seeded into 6-well plates along with siRNA and transfection reagents. Alternatively, for a forward transfection, adherent cells are seeded into 6-well plates the day before the transfection, and transfection reagents are added to the growing cells on the following day. The siRNA concentration of 75 nM here is used as an example starting point; it is actually the highest concentration that should ever be used. To avoid off-target effects, concentrations 1 - 10 nM are recommended.

## Setup
### Initial Cell Culture
- Cells should be in log growth around 70% confluence. For reverse transfections, cells can be growing in 6-cm or 10-cm dishes. For forward transfections, seed cells in advance into 6-well plates at a density that will give 50 - 70% confluence in the next two or three days. Scale up by increasing the number of wells, not by increasing the growth area per vessel. Jennie Mason has found that the transfection does not work well in any vessel larger than a well of a 6-well plate.
- Seed cells in 2.0 ml per well of complete medium without antibiotics. The final volume after the Opti-MEM + Lipofectamine + siRNA is going to be 2.5 ml per well.
- Incubate for 20 - 28 hours.

### Materials And Reagents
- Plastics: All mixes should be made in sterile low-adhesion polypropylene tubes using sterile barrier pipette tips. Do not use autoclaved plastics.
- TC-treated 6-well plates.
- Opti-MEM medium (Gibco 31985), equilibrated to 25 - 37 °C
- Regular growth medium without antibiotics
- siRNAs dissolved in RNAse-free water to 100 μM
- RNAiMAX Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen 13778###)

### Procedure
1. For each well to be transfected prepare mixes of:
	- 250 μl Opti-MEM with up to 750 nM (75 nM final concentration) total siRNA.
	- 250 μl Opti-MEM with 4 μl RNAiMAX Lipofectamine reagent. Add Lipofectamine reagent directly to the medium, do not add it as a drop clinging to the inside of the tube and then mix it in.
2. Incubate these mixes at room temperature for 5 minutes.
3. Combine the two mixes above and incubate at room temperature for 20 - 30 minutes.
4. Add 500 μl of the mix to each well of the 6-well plate(s) containing cells in 2.0 ml antibiotic-free medium, swirl to mix, and return to the incubator for 24 hours.

Example setup for two reverse transfections, a control and BRCA1 knockdown, each for two wells in a 6-well plate, plus appropriate dead volume:
1. Prepare mixes of Opti-MEM + siRNA for the non-silencing (NS) control and a BRCA1 knockdown using a cocktail of three siRNAs at equimolar concentrations. The total final concentration of RNA in each well is going to be 75 nM.
	- 4.5 μl of 100 μM siNS in 600 μl Opti-MEM (2 x 250 μl + 100 μl dead volume)
	- 1.5 μl each of three 100 μM siBRCA1 in 600 μl Opti-MEM (2 x 250 μl + 100 μl dead volume)
2. Prepare a mix of Opti-MEM + Lipofectamine for all the siRNA mixes above, plus appropriate dead volume:
	- 22.4 μl of RNAiMAX Lipofectamine in 1400 μl Opti-MEM (600 μl for siNS + 600 μl for siBRCA1 + 200 μl dead volume)
3. Incubate mixes separately for 5 minutes at room temperature.
4. Meanwhile, remove the media from the 6-cm or 10-cm dishes containing the cells to be transfected, wash with PBS, trypsinize, and neutralize the trypsin with complete medium.
5. Add 600 μl of the Opti-MEM + Lipofectamine to the tube containing 600 μl of siNS mix and then add 600 μl of the Opti-MEM + Lipofectamine to the tube containing 600 μl of siBRCA1 mix.
6. Incubate mixes for 20 - 30 minutes at room temperature.
7. Meanwhile, collect and spin down the trypsinized cells, resuspend in an appropriate volume of media, and seed into 6-well plates at 2.0 ml per well with enough cells to give 70% confluence in two days.
8. Add 500 μl of the appropriate mix to each well in the 6-well plate. Incubate for two days and then use the transfected cells for experimentation. No media change is necessary during the two day incubation.
