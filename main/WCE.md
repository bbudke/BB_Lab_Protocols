# Preparation Of Whole Cell Protein Extracts From Cultured Tissue Cells
By Brian Budke
___
## Overview
- The purpose of this procedure is to extract total cellular protein from growing cells. Samples prepared in this way are typically [quantified for total protein](Protein_Quant.md) and used in subsequent [western blot](Western_Blotting.md) experiments. Two lysis buffers and two extract collection methods are described. Both lysis buffers effectively lyse cells but I prefer NETN buffer as the lower detergent concentration makes it more compatible with colorimetric protein quantification assays. The NETN and RIPA recipes provided here are from Bethyl Laboratories; the NETN buffer used here has a higher salt concentration than the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory recipe.
- The assay procedures below assume that cells to be lysed have been grown to 30 - 70% confluence in 6-well cluster plates. This typically provides at least 50 μg of total protein. The amounts of reagent used here should be scaled appropriately according to growth area if growth vessels other than 6-well plates are used (a 6-well is 9.5 cm<sup>2</sup>).

## Lysis Buffer Options
- NETN buffer:
	- 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0
	- 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0
	- 250 mM NaCl
	- 0.5% NP-40 (IGEPAL CA-630)

- RIPA buffer:
	- 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0
	- 150 mM NaCl
	- 1.0% NP-40 (IGEPAL CA-630)
	- 0.5% sodium deoxycholate
	- 0.1% SDS
	- 1:1000 volume Benzonase (Sigma E1014-25KU)

### Preparation Of Buffers
1. Make lysis buffers fresh the day of use.
1. At a minimum, protease inhibitors should be added to the lysis buffer right before use. I typically use Roche Complete Mini protease inhibitor tablets, which I dissolve in 1 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O (for 10X concentration of protease inhibitor) and store in 100 μl single-use aliquots at -20 °C for up to one month. Each 100 μl aliquot is enough for 1 ml of lysis buffer.
1. Phosphatase inhibitors are also added right before use if phosphorylated proteins are being studied:
	- 10 mM sodium fluoride
	- 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate (stock solution is 0.125 M and kept at -20 °C)
	- 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (stock solution 0.2 M, prepared according to CSHP [doi:10.1101/pdb.rec092940](https://dx.doi.org/10.1101/pdb.rec092940))
1. Be sure to make enough buffer to lyse all the cells for an experiment, plus extra to be used as blanks or filler for protein quantification assays and gel loading.

## Lysate Collection By Scraping Up Adherent Cells
### Materials And Reagents
- Lysis buffer (made above)
- Cell scrapers

### Procedure
1. Transfer the plates to a large ice bucket and aspirate the media from each well.
1. Wash each well with 1 ml ice-cold PBS. Completely remove all of the wash in order to minimize dilution of the lysis buffer with PBS.
1. Add 30 - 100 μl of lysis buffer to each well, depending on the expected protein yield. I typically add 50 μl of lysis buffer to each well, which gives a total protein concentration of 3 - 10 mg/ml.
1. Scrape up cells and transfer each lysate suspension to a 1.5 ml tube on ice. Incubate lysates on ice for 30 minutes.
	- Benzonase is provided in RIPA buffer as an alternative to sonication to shear DNA.
1. Spin down the lysates at maximum speed in a microfuge at 4 °C for 5 minutes.
1. Transfer supernatants to clean 1.5 ml tubes on ice. Samples should either be used immediately or stored at -80 °C.

## Lysate Collection From Suspension Cells
- The samples used here can either be cells that were grown in suspension or adherent cells that were trypsinized and washed.

### Materials And Reagents
- Lysis buffer (made above)

### Procedure
1. Acquire a suspension of 1 - 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in media.
1. Spin down the media at 300 - 500 x g for 3 minutes, remove the supernatant, and add 1 ml ice-cold PBS. Transfer samples to 1.5 ml tubes (if they are in a different type of tube) and repeat the previous spin to pellet the cells.
1. Remove all of the wash supernatant to minimize dilution of the lysis buffer with PBS.
1. Add 30 - 100 μl of lysis buffer to each tube, gently resuspending the pellet.
1. Incubate lysates on ice for 30 minutes and follow Steps 5 and 6 above.
