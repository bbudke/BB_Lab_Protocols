## Preparation And Running Of Gel With Compound
### Overview
This assay measures the extent to which compounds intercalate dsDNA by running negatively supercoiled or relaxed covalently closed circular plasmid DNA through an agarose gel containing the compound to be tested. The compound is also present at the same concentration in the running buffer. Intercalation is detected as faster migration of the relaxed covalently closed plasmid through the gel as positive supercoils are introduced by compound intercalation. The migration of the relaxed plasmid is very sensitive to intercalation, as the introduction of a single positive supercoil can produce a detectable change in migration speed. Thus, very weak intercalators can be studied using this technique. Intercalation can also be detected as slower migration of the negatively supercoiled plasmid, which is relaxed by compound intercalation, though this effect is only visually obvious with stronger intercalators. Each concentration of each compound to be tested requires setting up a separate gel and rig, making the assay very low-throughput. However the assay is very sensitive and has fewer moving parts than intercalation assays that rely on enzymes to nick and reseal circular DNA in the presence of an intercalator, with the assumption that the intercalating compound does not directly interfere with the activities of the enzymes themselves.

The protocol below is optimized for compounds formulated in 100% DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the gel and running buffer is 4%. The presence of 4% DMSO does not appear to influence the migration of circular DNA relative to the linear dsDNA ladder.

In order to facilitate precise measurement of the apparent size of DNA topoisomers, each plasmid lane is run adjacent to a lane loaded with linear dsDNA ladder.

### Equipment And Reagents
- One agarose minigel rig for each concentration of each compound to be tested.
- Glassware should be rinsed in distilled water if it was autoclaved. The autoclave deposits a residue on everything that goes into it, which can interfere with sensitive assays.
- 50X TAE buffer:
	- 2M Tris base
	- Glacial acetic acid to pH 8.3 - 8.4
	- 50 mM EDTA
- Negatively supercoiled and relaxed closed circular plasmid DNA
	- Negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA is CsCl-purified from _E. coli_. Refer to the protocol for [CsCl Purification Of Supercoiled Plasmid DNA](CsCl_Plasmid_Prep.md).
	- Relaxed closed circular plasmid DNA is prepared from CsCl-purified negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA by following the protocol for [Preparation Of Relaxed Closed Circular dsDNA](Topo_Relaxed_DNA.md).
	- I routinely use pRS306, which is 4,373 bp long. Small plasmids work best for this assay because the topoisomers with the lowest absolute linking number are better resolved from the relaxed DNA.

### Procedure
1. Prepare 1X TAE sufficient for all gels and gel rigs, plus dead volume.
	- Each minigel uses 35.4 ml total volume.
	- The running buffer in each gel rig uses 290 ml total volume.
	- Adjust the amount of water used to make up the 1X TAE to account for the final concentration of 4% DMSO in all solutions. The DMSO Â± compound will contribute 1/25<sup>th</sup> of the final volume.
1. Prepare a sufficient volume of a 25X dilution of each compound in 100% DMSO for both the gel and the running buffer.
