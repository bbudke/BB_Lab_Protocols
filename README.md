Brian Budke's Protocols
=========

## Overview
This repository holds protocols used by Brian J. Budke in the Bishop/Connell research
group at the University of Chicago. The Connell group specializes in small-molecule inhibitors of the human RAD51 protein and therefore, most of the protocols are intended for testing drug-like compounds.

All files are written in Markdown format, a plain-text human-readable format that can be viewed and edited in any plain-text editor.

## Printing
If you want to print the protocols, use the awesome [GitPrint](https://gitprint.com) extension or bookmarklet. Or you can try the [Markdown Viewer plugin for Chrome](https://github.com/simov/markdown-viewer).
