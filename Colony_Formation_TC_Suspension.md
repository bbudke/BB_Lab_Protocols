## Preparation Of Semi-Solid Medium
### Overview
Semi-solid medium is prepared from methylcellulose powder, powdered culture medium, and sterile water. The "cp" designation of the methylcellulose refers to its viscosity in solution; 4000 cp is chosen for colony formation assays. Solutions of methylcellulose cannot be filtered, therefore it is necessary to autoclave either the powder or a 0.5 to 1.0% solution of methylcellulose. While use of autoclaved reagents and supplies are generally avoided in tissue culture, an exception must be made here. Methylcellulose is initially prepared as a dispersion in hot water; it is actually insoluble above 50 °C and preparing it in this way prevents the formation of gelatinous clumps that would make it very difficult to acheive a uniform solution. Upon cooling, the methylcellulose dissolves and the solution becomes viscous.

### Materials And Reagents
- Methylcellulose powder, 4000 cp
- Powdered tissue culture medium
- Filter-sterilized 18.2 MΩ water, heated to 65 °C
- Fetal bovine serum
- Optional media additives (e.g. pen/strep, sodium pyruvate)

### Procedure (Day 1)
1. Autoclave 10 g methylcellulose per 1 L of medium to be made in a glass bottle with a stir bar, dry cycle, 20 minutes, 121 °C.
1. Prepare a 2X solution of culture medium from the powder and 18.2 MΩ water, making sure to add the recipe amount of sodium bicarbonate if it is not already present in the powder. Filter-sterilize.
1. While the autoclaved bottle of methylcellulose is still hot, add approximately one-quarter final volume of hot sterile water and mix thoroughly to form an even dispersion of methylcellulose particles. Allow the dispersion to cool while stirring and then add the 2X culture medium. Continue stirring in the cold room overnight.

### Procedure (Day 2)
1. Add the fetal bovine serum and any optional media additives to the methylcellulose medium.
1. Top up to the final volume with sterile water and continue stirring in the cold room for at least 3 hours.
1. Store for up to a month at 4 °C.

## Treatment And Seeding Of Cells
### Overview
The procedure below is very similar to the [standard clonogenic survival assay for adherent cells](Colony_Formation_TC.md) used to test the effects of drugs on colony formation, with modifications to account for the handling of viscous semi-solid medium. Briefly, each sample is set up by combining 1.5 ml semi-solid medium + 0.5% DMSO ± agent 1, 1.5 ml semi-solid medium + 0.5% DMSO ± agent 2, and 100 μl of cell suspension in regular medium. This allows a two-dimensional matrix of dose pairs to be tested for synergy effects, or for a single drug to be tested by omitting agent 2 from the second addition of semi-solid medium.

### Materials And Reagents
- 6-well tissue culture plates
- Sterile polypropylene tubes
- Sterile syringes and 16-gauge pipetting needles

### Initial Cell Culture
- For experiments in which one or two agents are combined in liquid form with cells at the time of plating, a single dish of subconfluent cells may be used.
- For experiments in which cells are treated with one agent prior to plating (e.g. when radiation is administered), the cells are grown to subconfluence in one dish per dose of the agent being tested. For example, in an experiment in which six doses of X-rays including 0 Gy are being tested, there are six culture dishes that each get their own dose of radiation. If X-rays are to be administered, warm up the Maxitron before starting the procedure below.

### Procedure
1. For each agent, make working stocks of medium + DMSO ± compound by diluting compounds in 100% DMSO to 200X their final concentration and then add complete semi-solid medium to dilute the compounds to 2X their final concentration and the DMSO to 0.5%. Be sure to mix the compound thoroughly into the semi-solid media by inverting the tube several times. The mixing should be done in a tube large enough to ensure complete mixing by inversion; e.g., don't try to mix 14 ml in a 15 ml conical vial, use a 50 ml vial.
	- If compounds are made up in a vehicle other than DMSO, make the 400X dilutions in that vehicle first and then add medium + 0.75% DMSO, also keeping the vehicle concentration the same across all the samples.
1. Add 1.5 ml of medium + 0.75% DMSO ± agent 1 to the respective sample wells and then add 1.5 ml of medium + 0.75% DMSO ± agent 2 to the respective sample wells. Move the plates to the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator to allow the temperature and pH to re-equilibrate.
	- Both of these additions are performed even if one or both agents are not in liquid form (e.g. radiation) or absent. For consistency across experiments, these two additions are always performed.
1. If radiation is being administered:
	- Take the dishes of cells down to the warmed-up Philips RT250 Maxitron, including the control plate that receives 0 Gy. Use a disinfected styrofoam or plastic box to transport the cells.
	- Check that the 10 cm<sup>2</sup> cone and 1 mm Cu filter are installed. Set the distance from the end of the cone to the table to 10 cm.
	- Irradiate the respective plates for the time indicated in the table on the wall near the control panel. The dose rate is about 1.54 Gy/min with the above configuration.
1. Collect the cells from the dish(es) by trypsinization, spin down, and resuspend in 3 ml or appropriate volume of complete medium. Count the cells using the hemocytometer, taking care to get accurate counts.
1. Dilute the cells in complete medium to 10,000 cells per ml. Add 0.1 ml of this suspension to the top of the semi-solid media in each of the wells, drop-wise in an 'X' pattern so that the cells can be more easily dispersed throughout the medium.
	- Seeding 1000 cells per well is a good starting point for most cell lines. Adjust the seeding density as needed. There should be a few hundred of well-separated colonies in the control well(s) by the time they grow to >50 cells per colony, assuming a cell line that forms 0.5 - 1.0 mm diameter colonies.
1. Distribute the cells evenly in each well by semi-vigorous rotational shaking for at least 30 seconds. This is usually done by hand.
1. Incubate the plates until colonies of at least 50 cells form in the control well(s). This is usually 7 - 14 days. For consistency, once the incubation time for a particular cell line is known, use that incubation time for all subsequent experiments.

## Staining And Automatic Scoring Of Colonies
### Materials And Reagents
- Staining solution: 0.4% MTT in water
- Light table and camera

### Procedure
1. Carefully add 500 μl of staining solution to each well drop-wise with a P-1000 pipette, distributing the drops evenly on the surface of the semi-solid medium already in the well.
1. Return the plates to the incubator for a few hours, allowing the MTT to diffuse evenly through the medium and for the dark purple crystals of formazan to accumulate around the cells.
1. Acquire an image for each individual well:
	- Warm up the light table. Some light tables need to be left on for up to 5 minutes to reach a steady light output.
	- Position the light table below the camera and set up to take pictures. We use a Bio-Rad Gel Doc system to take pictures, though the settings below can be applied to any camera system.
		- No filter (move the UV filter out of the way)
		- Maximum tele zoom and nearest focus setting
		- White mode
		- Exposure time of 0.05 seconds.
		- Iris adjusted so that the brightest pixels are about 80% saturated with the light table positioned below the camera.
		- Save each image and export a TIFF copy.
		- As a courtesy to your fellow lab-mates, who use the Gel Doc almost exclusively for photographing agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide, move the UV filter back into position and open the iris all the way when you are done taking pictures.
1. Use the [BB Macros](https://github.com/bbudke/BB_macros) set for [NIH ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) to automatically score colonies.
	- The first time colonies from a particular cell line are scored, examine one of the wells at 40X magnification to get an idea of how big and brightly-stained a 50-cell colony looks. Adjust the focus enumeration settings in the macro so that it looks like colonies with at least 50 cells are being counted.
	- For consistency, use the same macro settings to score colonies for each cell line between experiments.
